# Parking Management System

## Project Overview
The Parking Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage parking operations efficiently. The system tracks vehicle entries, exits, parking slots, and calculates fees based on time spent. This project integrates MySQL for data persistence, providing hands-on experience in database management alongside core Java development.
The Parking Management System allowed me to apply these concepts in a real-world scenario, reinforcing my understanding and giving me the confidence to tackle more advanced projects. As I continue to explore Java, I am excited to take on new challenges and further enhance my skills in software development.

## Skills Learned
During the development of this project, the following skills were applied and enhanced:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
  - Designing and implementing classes.
  - Applying principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- **Database Integration:**
  - Setting up and managing a MySQL database.
  - Writing SQL queries for data manipulation (CRUD operations).
  - Understanding JDBC for Java-Database communication.

- **Collections Framework:**
  - Utilizing Java Collections like `List` for managing parking slots and vehicles.
  - Implementing iterators and streams for data processing.

- **Exception Handling:**
  - Creating and handling custom exceptions for robust error management.

- **Version Control:**
  - Using Git and GitHub for version control, project tracking, and collaboration.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core language for building the system.
